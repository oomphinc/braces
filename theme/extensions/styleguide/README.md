# Styleguides #
------------------------

The Stylesguides extension is made in order to have a single location for Designers and Developers to see a global
snapshot of the elements that make up the entire website. It will serve as a point of reference to build upon when
implementing initial styles as well as choosing to incorpoarte new features or components and how they will fit into
overall look and feel of the project.
